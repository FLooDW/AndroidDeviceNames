Android Device Names
===================

Android Device Names is a tiny 14 kB library that transforms the device model name into something people can understand. For example:

```
// returns "Samsung Galaxy Note 4"
DeviceNames.getDeviceName("SM-N910W8", "Unknown Device"); 
```

To get the name of the device you're currently running on, use

```
// returns the current device name, e.g. "Nexus 7"
DeviceNames.getCurrentDeviceName("Unknown Device"); 
```

What if my device is not on the list?
---

Currently, the library recognises about 400 devices. In case the device model is missing, a fallback you provide is used:

```
// probably returns "My Awesome Fallback"
DeviceNames.getDeviceName("OMG-WTF-LOL", "My Awesome Fallback"); 
```

Memory and performance?
---

There is no data container holding the device names. The `DeviceNames` class is generated by a Python script. `getDeviceName` method consists of if-elif-else statements, so there is absolutely no memory footprint, bar the string pool. 

The performance is great. With over 400 device names, a battered Samsung Galaxy S3 handles the worst case scenario, according to *Traceview*, in less than **5 ms**.
