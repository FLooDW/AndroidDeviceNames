Android Device Names
===================

Android Device Names is a tiny (13 kB) library that transforms the device model name into something users can understand. For example:

```
// the following returns "Samsung Galaxy Note 4"
DeviceNames.getDeviceName("SM-N910W8", "Unknown Device"); 
```

**How do I get the device model, you ask?**
`android.os.Build.MODEL` has the information you need. But typing that takes way too long! Instead, just use:

```
// returns a user-friendly name of the device this is run on, 
// e.g. "Motorola Droid Ultra"
DeviceNames.getThisDeviceName("Unknown Device"); 
```

**Surely some device names are missing, right?** Well, yes. You probably noticed the `"Unknown Device"` param. In case the device model is missing, a fallback you provide is returned:

```
// probably returns "My Awesome Fallback String"
DeviceNames.getDeviceName("OMG-WTF-LOL", "My Awesome Fallback String"); 
```

**So you're bloating the memory with a few hundred device names in some awesome data container that's never released, eh?** No, not really. If you disregard the string pool, the list is a bunch of if-elif-else statements, auto generated by Python. On an old Samsung Galaxy S3, a worst case scenario takes less then 20ms to complete. By the way, it supports Android 1.0&trade; and above.

**Alright, I'm sold. How do I get it?** Easy:
